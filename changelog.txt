#Version 0.3.0

=== CRITICAL ===
Weapon types have been split from "weapon" to "meleeWeapon" and "rangedWeapon".
A migration script will run, reading the "isRanged" property of all items and reclassify them as necessary.
The old "weapon" type will be deprecated in future versions.

Armor types have been split from "armor" to "armor" and "shield".
A migration script will run, reading the "isShield" property of all items and reclassify them as necessary.
The old "armor" has been changed, and some properties relating to shields will be deprecated in future versions.

The "weapon" type remains in the item creation menu, but it's creation dialog is intercepted with an error message.
It will be removed in the next release.
