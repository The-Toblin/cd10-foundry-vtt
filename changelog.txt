#Version 0.3.0

=== CRITICAL ===
Weapon types have been split from "weapon" to "meleeWeapon" and "rangedWeapon".
The old "weapon" type will be deprecated in future versions.

Armor types have been split from "armor" to "armor" and "shield".
The old "armor" has been changed, and some properties relating to shields will be deprecated in future versions.

The "weapon" type remains in the item creation menu, but it's creation dialog is intercepted with an error message.
It will be removed in the next release.

All skills have a new toggle, indicating if they are affected by "physical checks" debilitation. If this box is ticked,
all checks with this skill involved will include the modifier for physical deblitation. Otherwise it will be ignored.

A migration script will run on loading an older world and update all items accordingly. Skills will ALL be set to "false"
for the physical debilitation, so you will have to go through your skills and enable it for relevant skills.

=== General UI ===
- Set default size for character sheets and made it more responsive for resizing.
- Moved experience to the skills tabs.
- Moved coins to inventory.
- Created buttons and dialogs for complex attack checks as well as physical saves.
- Spells tab is now hidden by default and won't show up until the character has (knows) at least 1 spell.
- Unused sections in the inventory (armors, weapons, other) are now hidden if no such items are added.
- Added a left-click option on skills on the skill list to toggle the skill's "LevelUp" property, so players can track which skills can be upgraded at the end of a session.

=== Internal ===
- Armor coverage reworked from a string to an array of booleans. Sheet updated.
- Added system setting for simple, standard or complex damage types. Default: "standard"
- Added system setting for using hit location specific damage. Default: "false"
- Added system setting for displaying encumbrance. No mechanics implemented until active effects is done. Default: "false"

=== Mechanics and functionality ===
- Implemented single-trait rolls by clicking the roll icon on a trait. This will perform a blank check with that trait.
