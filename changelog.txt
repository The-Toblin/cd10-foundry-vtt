#Version 0.3.7

=== CRITICAL ===
With this version, weapons and skills will match against each other with a unique, persistent ID, rather than via name. This means you can now 
name your skills whatever you want and still have them match correctly against their weapon. A migration script will run to update the items upon
upgrading to version 0.3.7. 

If you have changed the name of a skill on a character, relative to the world-residing copy, it is quite possible for this script to fail for some skills.
That's unfortunately just the reality of the thing and is why this is being implemented in the first place; to fix mismatch issues based on name. 

If you end up with a weapon that doesn't properly match with a skill, try deleting both from the character and re-add them from world. 
(Still working on that script. Finish it!)

=== Bugfixes and internal ===
- Adjusted shield penalty for using a weapon+shield skill without an equipped shield from -3 to -2, as per the rules.
- Localized debilitation in the actor class (shown on sheets).
- Adjusted all "shippings" between classes and functions to work with Actor and Item IDs rather than full objects. 
- Attack checks and such now use a random "weaponMatchId" rather than name for matching skills to weapons. This is generated when a new skill is created.
- Fixed partials path in Item.js. Dumping descriptions for all items should work now.

=== UI and general fixes ===
- Converted all checkboxes to JS-toggled checkboxes, rather than HTML. More reliable toggling of stats.
- Added "Physical skill" to skillsheet. This allows you to toggle whether or not this skill is affected by physical debilitation.
- Typo fixed in weapon stats if complex damage is used. Damage types are now Slash, Pierce, Blunt and Energy instead of Slash, Pierce, Blunt and Blunt.

=== Mechanics and new functionality ===
- Dice rolls now take physical deblitiation into account. If you have a negative modifier due to injuries, but it isn't bad enough to affect all rolls, it will now only affect skills flagged "physical debilitation"
