## Major Changes

- Big rewrite of most js-files, especially CD10Dice.js.
- [CD10Dice.js](module/CD10Dice.js) is now much more structured and segmented, re-using code where possible.

// [ ] - Parry changed from a number to a simple -50% reduction in lethality.

- Substantial bugs in dice roller fixed. Now rolls a 0-9 D10 and handles 0's and 9's properly.
- Roll presentation updated. 9's and 0's are now presented in chat.
// [ ] Setting added for capping exploding 9's to a single instance.
// [ ] All cards (skill, trait, weapon, armor etc) updated to be postable to chat and have a uniform look.
// [x] Add + and - buttons to the health statblock, for mobile users.

#Version 0.4.4
== Bugfixes ==
Fixed bug in trait selection on the sheet. You couldn't unselect them. Now you can.

#Version 0.4.3
Fixed a mismatch in the initiative roll. It would erroneously grab the actor, not the token, leading to a mismatch of items, skills and modifiers and sometimes failing entirely.

#Version 0.4.2
Stable release.

#Version 0.4.1
Removed erroneously placed roll function in the itemEquip function on the named character sheet.

#Version 0.4.0
This is a platform release. This is a stable version you can keep using while the code rewrite and cleanup is perfomed. Version 0.5
will include all upstream changes to the system, like the simplified parry/block system, revised injury system etc.

== Major changes ==
- Removed Hitlocation
- Removed Encumbrance
- Removed complex checks button and dialog.
- Implemented faster way for trait (complex) checks. Left click on the trait's checkbox to select trait for skill check. 
    Right click to reverse the trait. This also works for attacks.
- Cleaned up unimplemented mechanics, simplified code.
- Remove shield check and defaulting to base combat skills instead of trying to work with "+shield" skills.
- "Weapon+shield" skills are deprecated and you have to remove them manually from your characters.
- Removed "Weapon" type from template.json. (Split into "meleeWeapon" and "rangedWeapon").
- Fixed a MAJOR bug in how injuries were calculated.

== Internal change ==
Weapons no longer match against the NAME of a skill, but a unique MatchID of the skill. This is evident when creating new weapons 
in the items-drawer. It will pick from all the skills in the item directory to populate the list of skills it can use. So if a character 
has a unique skill for a unique weapon, you need to create said skill in the items directory first, 
otherwise you won't be able to select it.
