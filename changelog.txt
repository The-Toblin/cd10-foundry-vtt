#Version 0.4.4.1
Big whoopsie in dice.js. Rollformula was incorrectly evaluated.

#Version 0.4.4
Minor bugfixes to CSS and Mook sheet. Mook sheet's equip panel is temporary and will be updated shortly.

#Version 0.4.3
Fixed a mismatch in the initiative roll. It would erroneously grab the actor, not the token, leading to a mismatch of items, skills and modifiers and sometimes failing entirely.

#Version 0.4.2
Stable release.

#Version 0.4.1
Removed erroneously placed roll function in the itemEquip function on the named character sheet.

#Version 0.4.0
This is a platform release. This is the version this system will stay on until the CD10 redesign is done. We
will release bugfixes as necessary to this version, but expect a massive change when v0.5.0 is released, which
will include the redesign changes.

== Major changes ==
- Removed Hitlocation
- Removed Encumbrance
- Removed complex checks button and dialog.
- Implemented faster way for trait (complex) checks. Left click on the trait's checkbox to select trait for skill check. 
    Right click to reverse the trait. This also works for attacks.
- Cleaned up unimplemented mechanics, simplified code.
- Remove shield check and defaulting to base combat skills instead of trying to work with "+shield" skills.
- "Weapon+shield" skills are deprecated and you have to remove them manually from your characters.
- Removed "Weapon" type from template.json. (Split into "meleeWeapon" and "rangedWeapon").
- Fixed a MAJOR bug in how injuries were calculated.

== Internal change ==
Weapons no longer match against the NAME of a skill, but a unique MatchID of the skill. This is evident when creating new weapons 
in the items-drawer. It will pick from all the skills in the item directory to populate the list of skills it can use. So if a character 
has a unique skill for a unique weapon, you need to create said skill in the items directory first, 
otherwise you won't be able to select it.
