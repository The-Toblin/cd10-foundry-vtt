#Version 0.5
Updated for Foundry V10
Big rewrite of most js-files, including CD10Dice.js.
Massive CSS update. Foundry is now styled beyond CD10-specific sheets.
// [ ] Template updates. Weapons no longer have a block/parry value. Shields no longer have protection.
// [ ] Blocking mechanics simplified to current CD10 system (half lethality).
Roll mechanics massively updated. Shouldn't make much difference for running games.
Roll evaluation updated. Now properly rolls a 0-9 D10 and handles 0's and 9's properly.
Roll presentation updated. 9's and 0's are now presented in chat.
Template data moved one step up from "Species": Value: <value> to "Species":
<value>. Labels and types are deprecated.
// [ ] Setting added for capping exploding 9's to a single instance.
// [ ] Make postable cards for weapons, armor and spells. Item context menus (right click) now include an option to post the description to chat, along with any skill-/traitvalue. 
// [x] Add + and - buttons to the health statblock, for mobile users.
// [ ] Update codebase to Foundry V10.
// [ ] Weapon's equipped status removed from item and move to the actor as actor.system.gear.
// [ ] Ranged weapon's selected ammo removed.

Both Mooksheets and Charactersheets now extend a BaseSheet class to simplify code and make maintenance less of a pain.
"Mook" type characters re-typed to "Minor" and "Named" characters are re-typed
to "Major".

#Version 0.4.4
== Bugfixes ==
Fixed bug in trait selection on the sheet. You couldn't unselect them. Now you can.

#Version 0.4.3
Fixed a mismatch in the initiative roll. It would erroneously grab the actor, not the token, leading to a mismatch of items, skills and modifiers and sometimes failing entirely.

#Version 0.4.2
Stable release.

#Version 0.4.1
Removed erroneously placed roll function in the itemEquip function on the named character sheet.

#Version 0.4.0
This is a platform release. This is a stable version you can keep using while the code rewrite and cleanup is perfomed. Version 0.5
will include all upstream changes to the system, like the simplified parry/block system, revised injury system etc.

== Major changes ==
- Removed Hitlocation
- Removed Encumbrance
- Removed complex checks button and dialog.
- Implemented faster way for trait (complex) checks. Left click on the trait's checkbox to select trait for skill check. 
    Right click to reverse the trait. This also works for attacks.
- Cleaned up unimplemented mechanics, simplified code.
- Remove shield check and defaulting to base combat skills instead of trying to work with "+shield" skills.
- "Weapon+shield" skills are deprecated and you have to remove them manually from your characters.
- Removed "Weapon" type from template.json. (Split into "meleeWeapon" and "rangedWeapon").
- Fixed a MAJOR bug in how injuries were calculated.

== Internal change ==
Weapons no longer match against the NAME of a skill, but a unique MatchID of the skill. This is evident when creating new weapons 
in the items-drawer. It will pick from all the skills in the item directory to populate the list of skills it can use. So if a character 
has a unique skill for a unique weapon, you need to create said skill in the items directory first, 
otherwise you won't be able to select it.
