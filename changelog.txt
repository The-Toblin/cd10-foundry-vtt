#Version 0.3.0

=== CRITICAL ===
Weapon types have been split from "weapon" to "meleeWeapon" and "rangedWeapon".
The old "weapon" type will be deprecated in future versions.

Armor types have been split from "armor" to "armor" and "shield".
The old "armor" has been changed, and some properties relating to shields will be deprecated in future versions.

The "weapon" type remains in the item creation menu, but it's creation dialog is intercepted with an error message.
It will be removed in the next release.

All skills have a new toggle, indicating if they are affected by "physical checks" debilitation. If this box is ticked,
all checks with this skill involved will include the modifier for physical deblitation. Otherwise it will be ignored.

A migration script will run on loading an older world and update all items accordingly. Skills will ALL be set to "false"
for the physical debilitation, so you will have to go through your skills and enable it for relevant skills.

=== Bugfixes ===
- Spell skillevel wasn't properly passed to the roll message, but was still internally applied.
- Automatic fails (rolling a 0) are now taken into account, and will automatically reroll to determine if you fumbled.
