#Version 0.3.7

=== Bugfixes and internal ===
- Adjusted shield penalty for using a weapon+shield skill without an equipped shield from -3 to -2, as per the rules.
- Localized debilitation in the actor class (shown on sheets).
- Adjusted all "shippings" between classes and functions to work with Actor and Item IDs rather than full objects. 
- Attack checks and such now use a random "weaponMatchId" rather than name for matching skills to weapons. This is generated in prepareDerivedData().
- Fixed partials path in Item.js. Dumping descriptions for all items should work now.

=== UI and general fixes ===
- Converted all checkboxes to JS-toggled checkboxes, rather than HTML. More reliable toggling of stats.
- Added "Physical skill" to skillsheet. This allows you to toggle whether or not this skill is affected by physical debilitation.

=== Mechanics and new functionality ===
- Dice rolls now take physical deblitiation into account. If you have a negative modifier due to injuries, but it isn't bad enough to affect all rolls, it will now only affect skills flagged "physical debilitation"
